        <p>Today I was really curious about this gator. What’s he doing here? Why’s he got a marker on an official Presidio Trust map?
        I had to get down there, down to where the map said he’d be. The mouth of Lobos Creek, it seemed. 
        I walked down a trail that was right across the road from the map. </p>

    <div class="entry6"> <p>The trail went along Lobos Creek, I was overjoyed to see it! I never saw any signs of a gator, though, 
            until I got to the end of the creek. He told me a story, one I think is best if it's his to tell.</p>
