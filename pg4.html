        <p>I could have sworn that yeterday I saw another map around here somewhere. I remember something weird, a reference to an alligator. 
            Maybe that’s the creature that left footprints by the lake! I never thought that an alligator could get here, 
            they’re not native to the area.

            If it is an alligator, which I don’t believe because that’s near impossible, he’d have to had come from sometime in
