            Now that I think about it, it’s possible that the gator hid during the cleaning. And now he’s been trekking about, causing a mess 
            throughout Lobos Creek and Mountain Lake Park. It seems odd that this could be a different gator than the one in the stories.

            I remember walking down the path some more, away from the chaos, towards Baker Beach. Maybe that’s where the map was?
